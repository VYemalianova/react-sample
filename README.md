# React + TypeScript Example Project

This is a simple React application built with TypeScript. It was created as a coding example.

## Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (with Hooks)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast bundling and dev server
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) for UI components
- [Sass Embedded](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass-embedded/) preferred over `node-sass` per official recommendation
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
